This repository contains the glue code to connect the following components together:
- BCSM_SGX. The doctor side SGX application to generate and sign Rx.
- BCSM_Miner in HyperLedger Fabric. The blockchain peer program that verifies the Rx.
- CONIKS. The key transparency system that stores doctor signing key.

There are two glue components:
- mkrx. Converts the raw Rx generated by BCSM_SGX into a compressed format before sending to the HyperLedger Fabric.
- vrftx. Provides the online verification service for BCSM_Miner in HyperLedger Fabric.
